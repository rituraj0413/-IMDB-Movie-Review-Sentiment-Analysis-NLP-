# NOTE: The pre-trained model `simple_rnn_imdb.h5` was saved with the
# TensorFlow/Keras 2.x stack. It is NOT compatible with Keras 3.x,
# which is why loading it currently fails with:
#   ValueError: Unrecognized keyword arguments passed to SimpleRNN: {'time_major': False}
#
# Pin TensorFlow to a 2.15.x release, which bundles Keras 2.15 and can
# successfully deserialize this legacy H5 model.
